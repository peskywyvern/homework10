# Write a class structure that implements a library. Classes:
# 1) Library - name, books = [], authors = []
# 2) Book - name, year, author (author must be an instance of Author class)
# 3) Author - name, country, birthday, books = []

# Library class
# Methods:
# - new_book(name: str, year: int, author: Author) - returns an instance of
# Book class and adds the book to books list for current library.
# - group_by_author(author: Author) - returns a list of all books grouped by
# the specified author
# - group_by_year(year: int) - returns a list of all books grouped by the
# specified year

# All 3 classes must have a readable __repr__ method!

# Also, book class should have a class variable which holds the amount of
# all existing books
